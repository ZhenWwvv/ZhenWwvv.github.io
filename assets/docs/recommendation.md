Reference for Ms Grace Zhen Wang 
I am writing to recommend Ms Grace Zhen Wang for any professional endeavors she may pursue. Ms 
Wang participated in the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Internship Programme from 15 May to 14 
November 2025, during which she focused on analysis and visualization of data and information within the
portfolio of the ILO's Youth Employment Unit.
During her time at the ILO, Ms Wang quickly proved to be an asset to the team, bringing with her
prior experience in programming, coding and data analytics. Specifically, she played an integral role in 
advancing core monitoring, evaluation and learning products, while maintaining high quality standards. Her
resourcefulness, schematic approach, and persistence in her duties were truly commendable.
Notably, Ms Wang was responsible for carrying out an analysis of the Youth Employment Barometer, 
an online global survey that captured perceptions and aspirations of young people vis-à-vis the labour market.
Additionally, she analysed an internal survey of ILO’s work on youth employment and developed an 
interactive dashboard to present key descriptive indicators across regions and departments. In doing so, she 
applied her knowledge of Phyton programming and successfully integrated her code into a new data platform. 
Ms Wang was exposed to diverse tasks and environments including delivering presentations of her 
analysis of youth perceptions to ILO youth employment experts. Throughout her time at the ILO, Ms Wang
demonstrated good communication skills and empathy when working both in teams and independently. She is 
professional, friendly, very responsive, and has a strong orientation towards learning and sharing.
All of the above describes a professional with substantive capabilities and drive to work in 
development economics in a multi-cultural setting. I recommend Ms Wang for any future professional 
opportunities. Please feel free to contact me at Puerto-gonzalez@ilo.org if you require any further information 
on her performance at the ILO.
